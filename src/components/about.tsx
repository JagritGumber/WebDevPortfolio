      <p>Hi, I'm Jagrit Gumber,</p>
      <p>
        I build anything and everything that seeks out my curiosity. Web apps,
        games, cross-platform applications, you name it, I make it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work throughout the application lifecycle from start to end, working
        at each abstract layer. UI/UX, backend, and DevOps, ensuring what I
        build is optimized, performant, and scalable for people to use.
      </p>
      <p>No person should suffer due to the developer's mistakes.</p>
    </section>
